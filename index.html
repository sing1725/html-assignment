 I opted Interactive media design program because of my own keen intrest in it altough i dont hold any past experience in this feild but i do beileve that if you have enough curiosity and intrest in it you will do wonders, its my third week and the only thing comes to mind without any shadow of doubt is that the course is really fun promisiong for the future and am really intrested in    
design graphics and photography web development seems to be intresting but bit challenging as well but i am pretty sure that i will be get used to it and do wonders in it as i have that level of curiosity in me.</p2>
